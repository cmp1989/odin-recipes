    </h2>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <l1>1/2 lb ground pork and 1/2 lb lean ground beef</l1>
        <l2>1/2 cup minced onion</l2>
        <l3>1 can tomato sauce (28 oz)</l3>
        <l4>1 can crushed tomatoes (8 oz)</l4>
        <l5>2 tbsp fresh parsley divided</l5>
        <l6>1 clove garlic crushed</l6>
        <l7>A dash of sugar</l7>
        <l8>1.5 tsp dried basil</l8>
        <l9>0.5 tsp dried oregano</l9>
        <l10>1.5 tbsp salt and 2 tsp salt</l10>
        <l11>1/8 tsp white sugar</l11>
        <l12>1/4 tsp ground black pepper</l12>
        <l13>3 large eggs</l13>
        <l14>1 (16 oz) pack of lasagana noodles</l14>
        <l15>1 lb small-curd cottage cheese</l15>
        <l16>1 (16 oz) package of shredded mozzarella cheese</l16>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <l1>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</l1>
        <l2>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</l2>
        <l3>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</l3>
        <l4>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</l4>
        <l5>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</l5>
        <l6>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</l6>
        <l7>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</l7>
        <l8>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</l8>
    </ol>
